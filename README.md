# PROJECT CONCEPT — Untitled Platformer/Combat Game

## OVERVIEW

A dark, atmospheric platformer inspired by _Hollow Knight_ — blending fluid combat and traversal with themes of **bureaucracy, decay, and societal expectation**. The tone is melancholic and oppressive rather than heroic. The world feels like it’s running on outdated systems — both literally and metaphorically.

---

## CORE LOOP (TBD)

**Premise:** The player explores a decaying city-state powered by an ancient system of "obligations." Every creature is bound by bureaucratic law — even death itself must be filed and approved.

**Goal Ideas:**

1. **Fulfillment System:** The player’s objective is to complete “Directives” issued by a central authority. These are essentially bureaucratic quests — collect, deliver, eliminate, report.
   - Completing them earns temporary “compliance” — a metric of stability or worth.
   - Eventually, the player realizes compliance fuels the city’s stagnation.
2. **Self-Assigned Goal:** After discovering the truth, the player may choose to stop following orders — leading to disintegration or rebellion endings.

## MOVEMENT + COMBAT FOUNDATION

### Movement

- **Double Jump:** Regain midair control, visually expressed as a pulse of spiritual energy.
- **Dash:**
  - Ground dash transitions into a roll if it hits terrain.
  - Aerial dash has diminishing momentum, making timing key.
- **Wall Cling:**
  - Slowly slide down walls.
  - Touching a wall resets jump cooldown.
  - Could tie into stamina or “focus” meter (to avoid infinite climb abuse).

### Combat

- **Precision Strikes:** Fast melee combat, with short recovery windows (think Hollow Knight’s nail + Sekiro rhythm).
- **Execution Attacks:** Only triggered when enemy morale breaks — cinematic and rewarding but costly to your own compliance meter (punishment for enjoying violence).

## MECHANICAL THEMES

| Concept       | Implementation                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bureaucracy   | Every ability, upgrade, or map unlock requires “forms” or “permits.” These are literal in-world items.        |
| Expectation   | NPCs and factions constantly judge your choices. Even saving someone might reduce your compliance rating.     |
| Corruption    | The higher you climb in the system, the more the world rejects you — environments glitch, enemies mirror you. |
| Documentation | Save points are “filing stations” where your existence is backed up as a record, not a soul.                  |

## WORLD STRUCTURE

- **The Ministry:** The hub area. Cold, metallic, and candlelit. Each department issues missions to maintain control over the “Outer Sectors.”
- **Outer Sectors:** The decayed remains of old bureaucratic projects. Think ruined offices, fungus-choked archives, and desolate transport tunnels.
- **Sanctums:** Optional challenge zones — ancient archives, where you can find outlawed knowledge or “unapproved emotions.”
- **The Citadel:** The top layer of society. Pristine yet lifeless — where the protagonist’s final revelation occurs.

## STORY THEMES & ARC

### Act 1 — Compliance

- The protagonist is a “clerical enforcer,” assigned to carry out directives.
- Every task seems justifiable but hollow.
- The city praises obedience; noncompliance leads to deletion.

### Act 2 — Realization

- You uncover that the Ministry no longer has a true ruler — directives perpetuate themselves automatically.
- NPCs begin to repeat their phrases, suggesting systemic breakdown.

### Act 3 — Collapse

- The player must choose:
  - **Continue Serving:** Maintain the system and live as part of it.
  - **Reject Orders:** The world begins to erase itself — your file is deleted.
  - **Overwrite Directives:** You become the new authority — but the world stays broken, only now under your name.

**Bad Ending Options:**

1. **Existential Bureaucracy:** Your rebellion is recorded as “anomaly #4,501,” filed and forgotten. The system continues without you.
2. **False Freedom:** You escape the Ministry, only to find an infinite sea of other Ministries — all filing the same forms.
3. **Compliance Complete:** You earn perfect obedience and are promoted into nothingness — an empty ascension.

## FEATURE IDEAS

### World / Systems

- **Directive System:** Dynamic quest system issuing tasks with absurd or contradictory objectives.
- **Compliance Meter:** Morality system tracking how closely you follow orders vs. act freely.
- **Ink & Seal Economy:** Collect ink to “stamp” upgrades. Seals are permanent progress tokens.
- **Record Trees:** Instead of bonfires, ancient record terminals where souls are archived.

### Visual / Aesthetic

- Stylized monochrome or muted palette with bursts of color tied to compliance level.
- The UI should feel like an old filing form — red stamps, typed headers, scratched ink.
- Environments built around decaying architecture — clockwork machinery, stacks of scrolls, and leaking pipes.

## TONE REFERENCES

- _Hollow Knight_ — environmental storytelling, tone.
- _Papers, Please_ — bureaucratic oppression.
- _Rain World_ — survival and inevitability.
- _Control_ — surreal bureaucracy and liminality.
- _Blasphemous_ — ritualistic decay.

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Define the **core loop** (how movement, combat, and compliance interact).
2. Decide on the **ending structure** — fixed or choice-based.
3. Establish a **prototype goal**:
   - Example: “Reach the Upper Records Office (first major area) while maintaining 70% compliance.”
4. Build basic movement physics and a test map to validate traversal feel.
