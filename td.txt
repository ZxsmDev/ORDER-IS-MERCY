Todo:
  - adjust ramp collision trajectory
  - change level collision object sweeps to check all object types (rect, ramp, radial, hazard)
  - allow smooth descent down ramp
  - unique interactable objects (doors, buttons) that communicate with the player
  - ramp gap collision detection
  - level instance swapping
  - level graph mapping and swapping
  - improved use of HUD
  - hazard implementation into collision (player hurtbox)

Potential Additions: 
  - level translator, given a level grid I can specify a size and choose what objects to place in each cell using a 
    predetermined list of object types which is then translated into json and converted into a level (started)
